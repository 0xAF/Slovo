Revision history for Mojolicious application Slovo

2018.04
    - Switched $CODENAME to U+2C0B GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER I (â°‹)
    - Improved documentation.
    - Added sqlite.conf which can be switched with pg.conf or mysql.conf.
      This way the database can be easily switched by adding specific
      adapter configuration files.
    - Added helper 'dbx' which will be instance of Mojo::SQLite, Mojo::Pg or
      Mojo::mysql instead of corresponding 'sqlite', 'pg', or 'mysql'.
    - Added a lot of generated code for tables 'groups' and 'users' with
      Mojolicious::Command::generate::resources.
    - Added Slovo::Cotroller.
    - Added first migration file. Table definitions and initial data are taken
      from Ado.
