L<CMS|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system>.

Or even if you don't have C<cpanm>.

    cd  Slovo-XXXX.XX.XX
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~/opt/slovo && make && make test && make install

    ./bin/slovo

=head1 CONFIGURATION, PATHS and UPGRADING

L<Slovo> is a L<Mojolicious> application which means that everything
applying to Mojolicious applies to it too. Slovo main configuration file is
in C<lib/Slovo/resourses/etc/slovo.conf>. You can use your own by setting
C<$ENV{MOJO_CONFIG}>. New routes can be described in C<routes.conf>. See
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig> for details and examples.

C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}> (where you installed Slovo) is automatically detected and
used. All paths then are expected to be its children. You can add your own
templates in C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/templates> and they will be loaded and used with
priority. You can theme your own instance of Slovo by just copying
C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/lib/Slovo/resources/templates> to
C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/templates> and modify them. You can add your own static files
to C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/public>. Last but not least, you can add your own classes
into C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/site/lib> and (why not) replace classes form Slovo.

With all the above, you can update L<Slovo> by just installing new versions
over it and your files will not be touched. And of course, we know that you are
using versioning just in case anything goes wrong.
